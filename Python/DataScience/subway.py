"""
In this optional exercise, you should complete the function called 
predictions(turnstile_weather). This function takes in our pandas 
turnstile weather dataframe, and returns a set of predicted ridership values,
based on the other information in the dataframe.  

In exercise 3.5 we used Gradient Descent in order to compute the coefficients
theta used for the ridership prediction. Here you should attempt to implement 
another way of computing the coeffcients theta. You may also try using a reference implementation such as: 
http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html

One of the advantages of the statsmodels implementation is that it gives you
easy access to the values of the coefficients theta. This can help you infer relationships 
between variables in the dataset.

You may also experiment with polynomial terms as part of the input variables.  

The following links might be useful:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression

This is your playground. Go wild!

How does your choice of linear regression compare to linear regression
with gradient descent computed in Exercise 3.5?

You can look at the information contained in the turnstile_weather dataframe below:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud359/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

Note: due to the memory and CPU limitation of our amazon EC2 instance, we will
give you a random subset (~10%) of the data contained in turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are hitting 
the 30 second limit that's placed on running your program. See if you can optimize your code so it
runs faster.

    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this computer on your own computer, locally. 
    
    
    If you'd like to view a plot of your cost history, uncomment the call to 
    plot_cost_history below. The slowdown from plotting is significant, so if you 
    are timing out, the first thing to do is to comment out the plot command again.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a 
    smaller number for num_iterations if that's the case.
    
    If you are using your own algorithm/models, see if you can optimize your code so 
    that it runs faster.
