is it possible to treat .js file as .jsp file using web.xml configuration?

Yes:

<servlet>
    <servlet-name>scriptjsp</servlet-name>
    <jsp-file>/script.jsp</jsp-file> 
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>scriptjsp</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/script.js</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
But, there is no actual advantage in doing this, because JavaScript files do not
 have to have URLs ending in ．.js・. What determines whether a file is a
 JavaScript file is what MIME media type it is served as. You can set this from JSP using:

<%@ page contentType="text/javascript" %>
at the top. Then you can link directly to:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/script.jsp"></script>
(Aside: in current browsers, scripts linked to with the <script> tag will work
even without having the Content-Type properly set, but that's probably not something to rely on.)

I want to use JSTL's fmt tag in javascript

This is probably not a good idea. The fmt tag deals with HTML-escaping for
characters, but what you want is JavaScript string literal escaping, for example
to backslash-escape quote characters. JSTL doesn't provide this capability. You'll
get unexpectedly-escaped ．&amp;・ characters showing up in your JavaScript strings,
and use of apostrophe or double quote in messages will break the whole script.

Also, serving commonly-included scripts from JSP risks poor performance and
cacheing.

I'd suggest an independent language lookup system in JavaScript. For example, include
a per-language external script:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/script/lang/en.js"></script>
(changing 'en' to match whichever language you want), and in that file define a lookup like:

var msg= {
    messageName: 'Message in English',
    ...
};
Then look up msg.messageName for each localisable string in the script.
